                Hello! Welcome! My name is Josepine Hilliard. Feel free to call me Jodie.If my friends could describe me, they would say Iâ€™m resourceful. I
                am very good at finding things, tangible and intangible. Throughout my work history, I had the pleasure of using many different applications 
                and software. I began to think about their inner workings. So I enrolled in a Rutgers coding boot camp. It taught me a lot about coding and
                programming and I created a few functional applications. I am a hard-working, self-motivated and ambitious individual with proficiency in HTML, NodeJS, React,
                JavaScript, MySQL, Bootstrap, and CSS, as well as ability to communicate effectively in a team setting, and possessing a strong willingness to learn about 
                entrepreneurship and business seeks to apply for an entry level Full Stack Developer position.
